## Motivation

As iOS developer I follow a lot of developers on Twitter. It's painful every time I saw a [rdar://](rdar://) in Tweetbot but cannot tap it to open. Therefore I created Ladybug, a solution for iOS to open or bookmark Radar links.

I use a lot of tools made by other developers. And I always want to contribute something to the community. With Ladybug I finally found something: **1.** I need. **2.** others might need too. **3.** I can do. Consider Ladybug my love letter to Apple dev community 😍. Enjoy!

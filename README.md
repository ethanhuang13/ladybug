Developers have mixed feeling about radars. Lots of radars never get close or response. Ladybug doesn't try to “fix” this situation, it just helps you to manage radar links or retrieve your records from Open Radar. If you want to file a radar while cross-posting to Open Radar, consider using [Brisk](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk-ios).

## Motivation

As an iOS developer, I follow a lot of developers on Twitter. It's painful every time I saw a [rdar://](rdar://) link in Tweetbot but cannot tap it to open. Therefore I created Ladybug, a solution for iOS to open or bookmark Radar links.

I use a lot of tools made by other developers. And I always want to contribute something to the community. With Ladybug I finally found something: **1.** I need. **2.** others might need too. **3.** I can do. Consider Ladybug my love letter to Apple dev community 😍. Enjoy!
